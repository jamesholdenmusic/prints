EXPERT SLEEPERS UNDERNEATH CASE - a large, no-screws (holding modules in) modular case, with two rows, a pair of speakers, and then 3x ES3 and 3xES6 mounted underneath the case.

EURO-KNOBS - a selection of largish knobs that work as a replacement for eg doepfer push on knobs. colour-coding your cutoff and resonance knobs (&etc) saves so much cognitive load, i recommend it.
