### MIDI FIGHTER SLIM
## CONSTRUCTION NOTES

# disassembly

the midi fighter is pretty easy to take apart. pull the knobs off, remove the feet, unscrew the 4 corners, once it's unscrewed the rubber sides come off easily.

# print

there are two parts where you'll want to check your printer tolerances:
- the led pipe covers - these should slide onto the led lightpipes (little cylinders that align with the leds to transmit light) - i printed them in black but white would be fine too. they were a snug fit with my printer.
- the buttons and their axle. i used a piece of filament as the axle that the buttons pivot on. i had to scrape at the inside of some of the holes to remove little defects to get it to in smoothly. worth printing one button to test first. this bit was a bit of a pain but not too bad - i used pliers to push the filament through the mounting holes carefully.

i tried a few settings to get the most transparent print i could - in the end large layer height and slightly higher temperature than i expected worked for the cheap transparent filament i had lying around.

for screws i used M3 ones into brass inserts (the kind you heat up with a soldering iron and push in) the ones between the top plate need to be 5mm or less in length. the hole diameter i've allowed is 4.2mm, you can adjust this in the 'sizes' spreadsheet in the freecad file.

# finishing

i bought a sheet of 1.5mm neoprene on ebay which fits perfectly in the base cavity and grips the table really well. you could also use normal self adhesive rubber feet.
