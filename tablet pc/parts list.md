this is designed around a particular set of components and may require changes if you use different parts.

cpu: any AM5, 9900X works well because it's quite efficient
mb: asus rog b650e-i
gpu: yeston single slot half height nvidia 3050
psu: hdplex 250w GAN
fans: 50mm gelid silent fans eg https://quietpc.co.uk/gel-silent5
ssd: any
ram: make sure the're not too tall/bulky

you'll need a range of screws, including some sligthly hard to find long M3 countersunk ones (accu had what i needed in the uk). i did have to saw the end off one screw to get the right length.

you'll also need to solder a DC plug onto the psu's sata power cable for the touchscreen, and you'll need to obtain internal an usb header-usb micro cable for the touchscreen and a short thin flexible HDMI cable - ebay had both of these.

you'll need kapton tape to seal the fan duct, i got a reel 2" wide, and 1mm double sided adhesive foam pads and thin VHB double sided tape for attaching the screen to its frame. and locktite 242 for all the screws.

if you do decide to build this get in touch with me first!
