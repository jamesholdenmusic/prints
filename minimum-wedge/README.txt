minimum wedge case! 
-------------------

- very light and rigid
- screwless fixing - just lift the T-section that clamps the modules in the middle and lift out modules. larger modules may need to be slid in from the end, but the ends come off easily.
- uses aluminium channel you can order cheaply online for most of the structure*
- scaleable width with a rear row for power/utility/expert sleepers/etc
- open frame makes finding faults easier! and lost screws fall out rather than rattling round the inside! (you can't fly with a modular for too long before vibration and bumps start disconnecting power cables, loosening screws and nuts and wires for you..)

* below i've put SKUs for the metal rails that you can find on metals4u.co.uk who i used - they them cut to size - but other suppliers may be cheaper.


i made mine 420mm wide (to fit what i wanted for my live setup). the whole case (empty) weighs less than 1kg and holds up to 243HP.

in my live setup i use an RME digiface and expert sleepers adat<->audio interfaces which i mount on the rear row of this case. this is all optional. using the filled-in end pieces is also optional - for a studio case i wouldn't bother - just print lots of ribs and have it open for easy access. on the covered ends i used prusaslicer modifiers to do honeycomb infill and no top/bottom layers on just the side panel areas.

the inside triangle space i've used for 2x Mungo power board (the old version that's narrower, he still has those available if you ask) but other busboards etc would fit. i've used self adhesive velcro to fix the power pcbs in place. this method has been fine for 3 years of touring over various cases even if it sounds sus. the ribs are 20mm, velcro comes in a 20mm width.

BOM: (no rme version)
---------------------

- (optional) rib-shallow-end-full-cover (x2, one mirrored)
- rib-shallow (as many as the width suits. i have 4 ribs (including ends) in my 420mm case.
- rail-insert-v-20 x as many as you need, feel free to scale them. printing them flat (ie horizontal, not the way they're drawn) is fine, plenty strong enough.

the rails needed are as follows:
- 4x alu T-track, 15.5mm x 7.5mm x 1mm (a C shaped channel, see pictures), as long as you want. SKU: ATT155X75X1
- 1x aluminium channel, 19mm x 19mm x 1mm (a U shaped square channel), same length SKU: 14792
- 1x aluminium T-section, 19mm x 19mm x 1mm, same length SKU: 14744

BOM: (rme version)
------------------

- rib-shallow-end-full-cover (nb mirror the file in your slicing software! this should be the left end)
- rib-shallow (as many as the width suits. i have 4 ribs (including ends) in my 420mm case.
- rib-rme-middle (nb mirror this file in your slicing software! the recess for the rme should be on the right side of this one)
- rib-rme-end-full-cover

rails for this version:
- 3x alu T-track, 15.5mm x 7.5mm x 1mm (a C shaped channel, see pictures), as long as you want. SKU: ATT155X75X1
- 1x the same part, but 135mm shorter
- 1x aluminium channel, 19mm x 19mm x 1mm (a U shaped square channel), same length SKU: 14792
- 1x aluminium T-section, 19mm x 19mm x 1mm, same length SKU: 14744

A FEW OTHER SMALL PARTS: (both versions)
----------------------------------------

both versions need a few T-grip-middle (one for each rib that isn't at the ends) and 2 T-grip-end-short
you need to carefully drill holes in the U shaped channel to screw it to the ribs
i used M3 heat set brass threaded inserts for this. 1 on each rib
in the RME version there are also some on the section below the RME where i've screwed in 2 output modules in my case, and 1 for a usb cable retaining hook next to the RME.
i've put fabric tape over the exposed U channel inside the case and door/window insulating adhesive foam strip all along the T to provide a nice firm grip on modules.

you can use friction to hold the T-piece in for studio use. for a travel case gaffer works (it comes in good colours..) or i'm currently sewing a webbing / velcro strap that i'll glue to the T piece.
