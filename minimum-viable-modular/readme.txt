MINIMUM VIABLE MODULAR

the idea is to put utilities (power, IO, computer interfafce, etc) in the end pieces. 

the modules you use are in the middle section. this can be printed as long as you want. 

it's held together by 4x M3 threaded rods (350mm with the middle piece the size I have it here). 

you can either use your own nuts, the nuts i've included here, or at one end (eg over an ES8) the cable cage is a nice way of making sure nothing comes unplugged in transit (or on stage!). my nuts and the cable cage use 10x5x2mm M3 rectangular nuts. these and the threaded rods are easy to find on electronics retailers, ebay, or etc..

files:
end piece - 2x
main section - extend or shrink if you want
cable cage - optional
nuts - 4x, optional. pause print and insert the rectangular nuts
