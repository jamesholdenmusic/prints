this case is designed to take 3x ES3 and 3x ES6, in a row, hidden underneath, with their own mungo scalable power board (mk1, the mk2 version wont fit but he still sells mk1), as well as 2 rows of modules with their own power board in the normal orientation. there's space at one end for 12HP of output modules (i use some silent arts/ 51x ones with DOAs and nice transformers, love them.) and an RME digiface usb to drive all the ES stuff.

front-facing modules are fixed using a latching system - no screws are used to hold modules in place. the plastic wedge plugs in the end hold an aluminium L section up, this engages with a tooth on the plastic lip that holds the modules in place. removing the plugs lets the L drop, then the lip can bend back.

for the speaker modules i used 2x this speaker with a 2x1W amp pcb off ebay that i soldered to a euro power connector.

you also need a couple of m3 threaded rods, some square m3 nuts (7mmx7mmx2mm) and the two aluminium L section pieces. i printed the underside parts in clear PLA so i could see the lights flashing.

i'm happy with this one, feels solid, the speakers sound good, the layout works - you can route wires through the inside to the digital modules so it ends up nice and tidy.
